### Hi there! 😁

My name is Marielle Porcidonio from Brazil (🇧🇷). 
I am a computer technician and a student of Systems Analysis and Development, and at the moment I am focused on learning Web Development. I have been working on some projects to put in my portfolio, feel free!

In my free time I like to plant 🌱, watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), read books (📚), listen to music (🎵) and occasionally beer (🍺).

Would you like to meet me?
